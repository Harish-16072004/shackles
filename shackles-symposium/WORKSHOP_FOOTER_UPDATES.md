# Workshop Card & Footer Layout Updates

## Changes Made (October 2, 2025)

### 1. âœ… Fixed Workshop Card Height
- **Location**: `frontend/src/pages/Home.css` - Category Card Section
- **Problem**: Workshop card was stretching too long compared to other category cards
- **Solution**: Added fixed minimum height and improved flexbox layout

#### Changes Applied:
```css
.category-card {
  /* Added properties: */
  justify-content: center;  /* Center content vertically */
  min-height: 300px;        /* Minimum height for consistency */
  height: 100%;             /* Ensure equal heights in grid */
}
```

**Impact**:
- All category cards (Technical, Non-Technical, Special, Workshop) now have equal heights
- Content is centered vertically within each card
- More consistent and professional appearance
- Better grid alignment

### 2. âœ… Social Media Icons in Row Layout
- **Location**: `frontend/src/components/common/Footer.css` - Social Links Section
- **Problem**: Social media icons (Instagram, LinkedIn) were not clearly displayed in a row
- **Solution**: Enhanced flexbox properties for better horizontal alignment

#### Changes Applied:
```css
.social-links {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;      /* Explicit row layout */
  gap: 1.5rem;              /* Space between icons */
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
  align-items: center;      /* Vertical centering */
}

.social-links a {
  /* Added property: */
  flex-shrink: 0;           /* Prevent icons from shrinking */
}
```

**Impact**:
- Instagram and LinkedIn icons now clearly display side-by-side
- Consistent spacing between social media icons
- Icons maintain their size and don't compress
- Better visual hierarchy in the "Follow Us" section
- Mobile-responsive: Icons stay in a row even on mobile devices

### Footer Social Icons (Before â†’ After)
- **Before**: Icons displayed vertically or inconsistently

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Workshop Card**: Verify all category cards have equal heights on desktop and tablet
2. **Social Icons**: Check that Instagram and LinkedIn icons display horizontally
3. **Mobile View**: Test footer on mobile devices (375px, 414px, 768px widths)
4. **Hover Effects**: Ensure card hover animations still work smoothly

## Files Modified
1. `frontend/src/pages/Home.css` - Category card height and alignment
2. `frontend/src/components/common/Footer.css` - Social links row layout

---

## Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop**: All cards equal height, social icons in row
- **Tablet (â‰¤768px)**: Cards stack vertically, icons remain in row
- **Mobile (â‰¤480px)**: Optimized spacing, icons centered in row

The layout is now more consistent and professional across all screen sizes! ðŸŽ‰
